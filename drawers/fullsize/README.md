# Full-Drawer Photos

This folder is where you want to put all your images of drawers. It's important to put them all here, as this is where the process_images command will look for the initial photos!

For now these should be JPGs, but future versions may allow for other image types.

**All other folders/directories will be generated automatically as the script processes the images**
