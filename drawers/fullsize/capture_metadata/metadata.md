# Image Metadata: FMNH / GIGAMacro Only

To convert pixels to true measurements (e.g., length or area in mm), each drawer JPG needs an associate TXT file generated by the GIGAMacro system. This folder contains the required .txt file for the test image.

**Note: this step is not necessary if all photos have the same pixel:{size} ratio**
- If this is the case, simply skip the process_metadata step
