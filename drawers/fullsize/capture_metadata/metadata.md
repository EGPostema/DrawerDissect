# Image Metadata: FMNH / GIGAMacro Only

To convert pixels to true measurements (e.g., length or area in mm), each drawer needs an associated TXT file generated by the GIGAMacro system. This folder contains the required .txt file for the test image, which gets matched by the capture timestamp.

**Note: this step is not necessary if all photos have the same pixel:{size} ratio**
- This step is skipped by default
